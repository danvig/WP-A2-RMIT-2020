        <p style="line-height: 30px;">We understand that the current crisis in our world means <br> our services can't be physically accessed at this time. It's because
        <br> of this that we are switching to online training. All members, new and current <br> have access to these services. Members should contact their personal trainer 
        <br> to organise their online training sessions. Online services include training <br> sessions via Zoom and weekly mental health check-ins with our mental health <br>
        professionals. These services are included at additional cost to your monthly fees. <br> <a href="healthdiary.php">Click</a> to try our online health diary, available for free.

                <h3>Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                    Yoga is a Hindu discipline that includes breath control and meditation. Yoga has been practiced for years, primarily due to its health benefits. Yoga can be used to build muscle strength, and regular sessions can help you sleep and boost your immune system. The benefit of yoga is that it is suitable for people of any age and fitness level, and yoga is the one activity that works the mind as well as the body. Our yoga instructors are professionals in the field and run multiple classes a week under strict schedules.
